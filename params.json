{"name":"GriffinVC","tagline":"python and vlc based behavioral video coding program","body":"The Animal Behavior and Conservation Program at Hunter College supported the development of a free video coding software, GriffinVC, for research on the dynamics of social and cognitive development. The program was developed in the Python computer language, using the wxPython graphical user interface library and the Python bindings for VLC media player. The program consists of three main elements: the video player, the ethogram window, and a spread sheet for time-stamped observations. The software has several advantages over other video coding programs as it runs on Windows 7/8, MacOS, and Linux operating systems, remains available online, is free and open-source, and supports all the video formats supported by VLC. \r\n\r\nDownload here: https://github.com/svirs/griffinVC/releases\r\n\r\nSource files here: https://github.com/svirs/griffinVC/\r\n\r\n[Griffin Help File.pdf](https://github.com/svirs/griffinVC/blob/master/griffin_march12.pdf)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
